# Projekt-2-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
This is the second coding project at the Nod Analytics Bootcamp. In this case a webscraping endeavor named "Beating CodeWars".

I elected to scrape 'Codewars' (https://www.codewars.com/), a website where one can solve coding problems made by the community and you gain levels by doing so. The purpose of the website is the hone your programming skills in a fun way.

The ultimate goal of the webscraping was two fold:

1) Do an exploratory data analysis to see what we can learn about the data by building a DataFrame
2) Use the data to give us an edge when it comes to selecting problems on the website

You yourself can also use the data to get an edge when choosing katas by accessing this streamlit web application (NOTE: ignore the error messages that pop up on application start): https://kata-selector.herokuapp.com/
